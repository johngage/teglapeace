TLPF is a charitable organization that focuses on **restoring peace and fostering economic empowerment among pastoralists**. It was established in 2003 by Tegla Loroupe, a Kenyan marathon legend and the Foundation’s President. Essentially, TLPF focuses on rebuilding social relations and developing trust among communities at war over scarce water, scarce pasture, and increasingly fragile and threatened vital resources for their herds and crops, in some of the world's most impoverished nomadic communities.

Fifteen years of **Peace Races** showcase sports as an alternative economic livelihood pathway to the warrior's traditional practice of cattle rustling, with the creation of a Warrior's Training Center for those who put down their weapons and choose peace.

The **Peace Races** gather a broad community, and are designed to increase awareness of girl child rights, to foster education, and champion peace and cooperation as the future for all tribes. Peace demands a fundamental change in the perception of pastoralists towards cattle raiding as a form of livelihood.

With a vision of *A Peaceful, Prosperous and Just World In Which Sports is a Unifying Factor*, the Foundation’s continued activities restore peace among warring pastoralists through sports, and build a foundation on which to make a difference in the lives of the less privileged. 

### Our Mission

To promote peaceful building, livelihood and resilience of poor people affected by violence and vulnerable to conflicts and civil strife in the world

### Our Vision 

A peaceful prosperous and just world in which sports is the unifying and livelihood factor
